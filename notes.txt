Pages and MVP Functionality:
 - Login: Shows on root route if token does not exist
    - Redirects to spotify auth
 - Home: Shows on root route if token exists
    - Displays all public playlists the user has created
 - Input: Shows once a user clicks a playlist from Home
    - Displays all songs in the playlist with bpm as well as other metadata
    - Has numerical input for desired bpm (hardcode the leniency for now)
    - Has button for performing the search
 - Results: Shows search results once a user clicks the search button from Input
    - Displays subset tracks from playlist that match the desired bpm

Next Steps:
 - Convert app to use Auth with PKCE instead of plain auth, its safer that way
 - Allow option to add tracks in Results as a new playlist, name it too
 - Select multiple playlists to search through
 - Sort by bpm on Input
 - Input distance and time instead of BPM and my code will calculate BPM
 - Option to use public playlist by share link
 - Other input subset options (albums, top tracks, artists, etc...)
 - Ability to modify playlist before adding to library
   - Remove tracks that matched the search
   - Add tracks from the chosen input that didn't match the search
